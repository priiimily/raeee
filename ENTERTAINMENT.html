      <p>Liza Soberano is having the time of her life in the United States as she met another international artist, Korean-American singer Woosung of the South Korean band The Rose.

The actress got to see Woosung, along with his other companions, during her visit to Manhattan, New York, as seen on her Instagram page today, June 9. She also got to see the K-pop artist do a live performance of his song “Face.”
 <br>
Soberano has been spending time in the US just as her former manager Ogie Diaz announced that she is now managed by the team of her fellow actor James Reid.</p>

      <h3><b>WATCH: ‘The Hunger Games’ prequel drops first look teaser</b></h3>
      <h5>By: Dana Cruz <span class="w3-opacity">02:36 PM June 07, 2022</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container" >
      <p> “The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes,” the prequel film to the hit movie series “The Hunger Games,” has finally released its official first-look teaser, and it is quite golden.

The teaser did not show actual footage from the film, since it is still in production. Instead, it features a snow-covered snake slithering next to an icy bird. Both animals eventually shedded the snow to reveal their golden bodies, as seen on the official Twitter account for The Hunger Games film franchise yesterday, June 6.
<br>
“You’re invited to return in 2023. The world will discover who is a songbird and who is a snake,” it stated.
